# LED board documentation

One LED board consists of 5 8x8 LED matrixes. Multiple boards can be daisy-chained. Our Stra√üenbahnanzeige has 3 board; a total resolution of 8x120 pixels.

There are five shift registers. They are connected to the LED matrixes and chained by connecting the `SER OUT` of a shift register to the `SER IN` of the next one.

Multiple LED boards can be chained together.

The input connector is on the more densly populated side of the board. All pins except for 7, 8, 9 and 10 are connected directly to the output connector. The data pins 7, 8, 9 and 10 are buffered by a 74HC244 and connected to the shift registers. The buffered outputs (except for the serial data line) are connected to the output connector. The data line is passed through all shift registers, the `SER OUT` of the fifth (last) shift register is then connected to the output.
